I love doing super spontaneous things like hiking, seeking out popular cafes at Oakland and SF, singing spontaneously with friends at the Rose Garden, and sometimes a late night talk about social justice. I also love to dabble in art- I like to draw and sketch and LOVE to do fancy lettering.

        		<br><br>Aside from hobbies, I also have deep rooted passions that I’ve had since middle school/ high school. In my time here at Cal, I’ve been able to pursue many of them: I really hope to become a doctor someday and with that in hope, I have taken a decal and shadowed several doctors in SF. I have also explored spirituality here at Cal with Christian fellowships and churches (Gracepoint, KCCC, Living water, Ark, Cru, Christians on Campus…)I also have a passion for you all!

Some things about me are that I really really really love dogs (usually more than I like people)!!! If you like cats better than dogs we CANNOT be friends. Never. Ever. Jk. Another thing about me is that I love food. Especially things that are likely to kill me or lead to major health problems in the future, such carbs and sweets (chocolate chip cookies are life). But besides these weird facts, I also work and volunteer. Currently I volunteer at Oakland Children’s Hospital where I make arts and crafts with patients in the Emergency Department Waiting Room. I also work as a Caregiver and have both a CPR and CNA (nursing assistant) license. Lastly, I love using parenthesis which people find really annoying, especially in written pieces like this.
